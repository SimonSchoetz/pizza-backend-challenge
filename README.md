# Creating a small page for ordering pizza
Initial idea from Robert in this repo: https://github.com/losrobbos/fbw17-lots/blob/master/projects/README.md

- Focusses more on the back-end (JS)
- Design is secondary - for now

## Brainstorming:

- Web site to create own pizza by choosing ingredients
- one-click-selector for popular pizza (presets)
- Different categories of ingredients
- each ingredient with its own prize
- filter ingredients (veggie, vegan option)
- option between pickup or delivery
- Categories
  - dough
  - different kinds of sauce
  - toppings
    - different kinds of cheese
    - d. k. o. ham/sausage
    - shrooms
    - d. k. o. salad (e.g. ruccola)
  - spices(like oregano)
  - flavoured oils (e. g. chilli, garlic)


Shows order with final prize + shipping (and tax'n'shit?)


## What to Research:

- How to use javascript infrastructure with html buttons'n'shit <br>
  (select/deselct into ingredients array or smth. like that)
- How to display results on the web site

## Bonus

- add pizza to shopping cart
- make another pizza or just x2
- safe own preset (cookies)
- option to work on an already locked pizza again

## TODO

- Start with a basic front-end page until Eva sent research material regarding DOM
  - Buttons with ingredients/Topics
- Research DOM
- Set up whatever is required in JS

### Brainstorm todo 
- Array: Already in there: Dough, shipping
